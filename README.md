# About The Project

A CLI app made with nodeJS. This quiz is about how well do you know me. You will be asked questions about me and if your answer is right you will get one point. You can't score less than zero üòù.

## What's a CLI?

Well! If you are from a non programming backgroud, there are chances you have never interacted with a CLI app. Those are pretty obsolete now from the end user scene. But programmers use them all the time.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a CLI (Command Line INTERFACE).

Think of it as texting with a program instead of you know the usual clicking of buttons.
